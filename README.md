The "Weather Prediction" project aims to use Machine Learning and Native Bayes theorem to predict future weather conditions based on past observations. This project will utilize historical weather data to train a Native Bayes algorithm, which will then make predictions about future weather patterns.

The project will involve collecting large amounts of weather data, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and other relevant weather factors. This data will be used to build a model that can identify patterns and correlations between weather conditions and predict future weather patterns with high accuracy.

The Native Bayes theorem is a probabilistic model that utilizes Bayes' rule to calculate the probability of an event occurring based on prior knowledge. In this project, the algorithm will use the probabilities of different weather conditions occurring based on past observations to predict the likelihood of future weather patterns.

The project will involve using various Machine Learning techniques such as data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training to develop a robust and accurate predictive model. The accuracy of the model will be evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.

The potential applications of this project are significant, including improving the accuracy of weather forecasts and aiding in disaster preparedness and response efforts. By accurately predicting weather patterns, this project has the potential to make a positive impact on various industries such as agriculture, transportation, and energy.
